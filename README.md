## Installation
1. Open your neovim config (`:e $MYVIMRC`)
2. Add the command `vim.cmd "colorscheme prasiodark"` to the end of your `init.lua` if you want this colorscheme to be enabled at startup
3. In the same directory, create a folder named `colors/`
4. Copy `prasiodark.lua` into that folder
5. Run `:colorscheme prasiodark` or restart neovim
6. Enjoy!

## Coming ~soon~ eventually:
- Light mode
- Support for more languages
  - The languages I use (C, C++, Rust, Python) all work, but if something seems wrong with a language you use, please file an issue!
- Installation through a plugin manager
